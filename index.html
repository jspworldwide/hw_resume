			<p>From an early age, Jonathon has always been passionate about growing and scaling businesses--a true entrepreneur at heart.</p>

			<p>Jonathon attended Pace University and pursued a degree in Political Science before founding Elite Daily. Recognizing that the media landscape lacked a property that effectively synthesized the wide spectrum of millennial interests into a digestible format they could relate to and engage with, Jonathon joined forces with David Arabov to found Elite Daily, which has become popularly known as "The Voice of Generation-Y".</p>

			<p>Jonathon combined his marketing background with a measured approach to corporate operations to build and scale the Elite Daily team and brand presence to new heights. Realizing that a conversational editorial voice and a tacit understanding of millennial interests were essential to engaging the millennial generation, Jonathon defied industry standards by employing a staff entirely comprised of millennials. Under Jonathon's leadership, Elite Daily has grown from 60,000 monthly unique visitors in February of 2012 to 75 million monthly unique visitors in December of 2014.</p>

			<p>Jonathon has received a number of accolades for his work at Elite Daily, including a spot in Business Insider's 2014 "Silicon Alley 100" and a nomination for Forbes 30 under 30.</p>

			<p>Jonathon Francis is the COO and Co-Founder of Elite Daily.</p>
